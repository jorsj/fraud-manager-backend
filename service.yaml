# This is a service definition for the Fraud Manager Backend for Google Cloud Run.
#
# You can use this file with the `gcloud run services replace` command:
#   gcloud run services replace service.yaml --region <REGION>
#
# Before using, you need to replace the following placeholders:
# - PROJECT_ID: Your Google Cloud Project ID.
# - REGION: The GCP region for the service (e.g., us-central1).
#
# Note: The `image` will be automatically updated by the Cloud Build process
# when you deploy from source using the `deploy.sh` script. If you are deploying
# a pre-built image, you should update the `image` field with the correct path.
