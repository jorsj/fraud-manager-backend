# Firestore Database Design

**`queries`**: Stores a record of each valid query made. Each document represents an interaction.
*   **Document ID**: Auto-generated by Firestore.
*   **Fields**:
    *   `phone_number` (String): The caller's phone number in E.164 format (e.g., `+56912345678`).
    *   `national_id` (String): The National ID that was queried.
    *   `query_timestamp` (Timestamp): The exact date and time of the query, crucial for period-based filtering.

**`blocked_phone_numbers`**: Contains phone numbers that have been manually blocked by customer service agents.
*   **Document ID**: The phone number to be blocked. Using the number as the ID allows for very fast and efficient existence checks.
*   **Fields (Optional for auditing)**:
    *   `reason` (String): Reason for the block (e.g., "Reported by customer for fraudulent call").
    *   `block_timestamp` (Timestamp): When the block was applied.
    *   `agent_id` (String): Identifier of the agent who performed the block.
